Notice for Midterm 1 

Midterm 1 will take place during the scheduled lecture times on October 4 (Friday):

3 PM for 2UG/2GR
4 PM for 1UG/1GR

Here are some logistics:

- Ensure you take the exam for your enrolled course.
- The exam is closed book and closed notes.
- Bring a calculator.
- You may bring a single-sided, letter-sized, hand-written cheat sheet.
- Since the cheat sheet must be handwritten, do not copy/paste lecture notes or R-code output onto the cheat sheet.
- A chi-square table will be provided.

A sample exam will be uploaded on Canvas later this week.
